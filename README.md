Alarm.java: This is just a basic, starter alarm clock application that I made using GUI and Java Swing to showcase a digital alarm that allows a user to add input fields for setting and stopping an alarm at specific
times. Along with this, it displays the current time along with handling integrating an audio ringtone for the alarm.
