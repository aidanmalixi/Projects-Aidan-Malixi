Alarm.java: This is just a basic, starter alarm clock application that I made using GUI and Java Swing to showcase a digital alarm that allows a user to add input fields for setting and stopping an alarm at specific
times. Along with this, it displays the current time along with handling integrating an audio ringtone for the alarm.

CryptographyProject: This project was used for my final in my information in network and security course, in which we were to demonstrate the crypographic techniques and communication methods that we learned throughout the semester. It covers key exchange, encryption/decryption, digital signatures, and secure message transmission. The toolkit is designed to provide a practical understanding of cryptographic principles in software security, with features such as Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange, DES Encryption/Decryption, AES Key Generation, Digital Signatures, and Stream Cipher Demos.
