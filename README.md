Alarm.java: This is just a basic, starter alarm clock application that I made using GUI and Java Swing to showcase a digital alarm that allows a user to add input fields for setting and stopping an alarm at specific
times. Along with this, it displays the current time along with handling integrating an audio ringtone for the alarm.

CryptographyProject: This project was used for my final in my information in network and security course, in which we were to demonstrate the crypographic techniques and communication methods that we learned throughout the semester. It covers key exchange, encryption/decryption, digital signatures, and secure message transmission. The toolkit is designed to provide a practical understanding of cryptographic principles in software security, with features such as Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange, DES Encryption/Decryption, AES Key Generation, Digital Signatures, and Stream Cipher Demos.

Marketing Projects: (in Python) Projects used to demonstrate and simulate marketing concepts like customer value life and campaign success. 

In the first code, CVL.py, I used a synthetic dataset to simulate customer transaction patterns like the customer IDs, total amount spent, and days since last transaction. This was used to act as a prediction model to try and inspect customer trends and figure out what their future business transactions can look like. Along with figuring out the overall CVL, the code allows for visual representation using packages like seaborn and matplotlib to create graphs that can represent the relationships betweeen the datasets. 

In the second code, MarketPredict.py, I used both sqlite and python to use data management and predictive modeling to analyze marketing campaigns. The code organizes data (like the budget and sales) into a database file using sqlite, and then calculates the average sales. Alongside this, it creates a graph that uses linear regression models to predict sales based on budget allocations to spectate and take action on it. Overall, the code functions as a way to organize data to enhance a marketing campaign performance.
